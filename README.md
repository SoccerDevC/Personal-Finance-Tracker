It is all about tracking a person's finance health
Title: Personal Finance Tracker

Description:
Create a personal finance tracker application that helps users manage their expenses, track their income, and monitor their overall financial health. The application could have the following features:

Expense Tracking: Allow users to log their daily expenses under different categories (e.g., groceries, utilities, transportation) and store them in a database.

Income Tracking: Enable users to add their sources of income, such as salary, freelance work, or investments, and track them over time.

Budget Management: Allow users to set monthly budgets for different expense categories and provide visual feedback on their spending habits, such as progress bars or charts.

Financial Overview: Provide users with an overview of their financial status, including total income, total expenses, and a breakdown of spending by category.

Notifications: Implement reminders and alerts to notify users of upcoming bill payments, budget limits, or unusual spending patterns.

Data Visualization: Generate interactive charts and graphs to visualize spending patterns, income trends, and budget comparisons over time.

Goal Setting: Allow users to set financial goals, such as saving for a vacation or paying off debt, and track their progress towards those goals.

User Authentication: Implement a user authentication system to ensure privacy and data security for each user's financial information.

This project will give you an opportunity to work with data management, user interface design, data visualization, and potentially incorporate external APIs for currency exchange rates or investment data. It will also help you gain insights into personal finance management and provide a useful tool for yourself and others to track their financial progress.
